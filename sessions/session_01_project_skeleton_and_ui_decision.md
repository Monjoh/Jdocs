# Session 01 — Project Skeleton & UI Framework Decision

**Date:** TBD
**Goal:** Choose the UI framework, set up project dependencies, create the app entry point with a basic window.

## TODOs
- [ ] Decide: PyQt5 vs CustomTkinter
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with all planned dependencies
- [ ] Create `src/main.py` — app entry point with basic window
- [ ] Create basic layout skeleton (drag zone placeholder, search bar placeholder, sidebar placeholder)
- [ ] Verify the app launches and displays the window
